Image assets
===============

Place campaign images in this folder to use them locally (recommended for production).

You can use JPG, PNG or SVG files. This project includes SVG placeholders so the site works out-of-the-box.

Suggested filenames (update HTML if you use different names):
- hero.svg / hero.jpg            — Main hero banner (recommended 1600x900)
- portrait.svg / portrait.jpg    — Dr. Erick Mutai portrait (recommended 800x800)
- irrigation.svg / irrigation.jpg — Agriculture / irrigation project
- healthcare.svg / healthcare.jpg — Healthcare facility
- roads.svg / roads.jpg           — Infrastructure / roads
- youth.svg / youth.jpg           — Youth empowerment / training
- volunteer.svg / volunteer.jpg   — Volunteer / mobilization
- office.svg / office.jpg         — Office building
- gallery-1.svg .. gallery-5.svg  — Additional gallery images

This repo ships with SVG placeholders named `*.svg`. To replace them, add same-named JPG/PNG files or overwrite the SVGs with your images.

If you uploaded images in this chat, save them to the following paths so the site will use them automatically:

- `assets/images/portrait.jpg` — official portrait (I can place the uploaded portrait here if you confirm)

After you confirm, I will add the uploaded image to `assets/images/portrait.jpg` and update pages accordingly.
